# Lab2

## Task2 instructions

In this task, you will be working with a client-server architecture. To get started, you need to downloade both the client and the server on your machine.

### Installation

First, you need to download the necessary files:

- `client.py`
- `server.py`

Ensure both files are in the same directory to proceed with running the programs.

### Running the Server

Open your command line interface and navigate to the directory containing the downloaded files. Run the following command to start the server:

```bash
python3 server.py
```

### Running the client

After you have the server running, you can start the client in a new command line interface window. Navigate to the directory where client.py is located and run:

```bash
python3 client.py
```
